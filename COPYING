The files in here are mostly copyright (C) Free Software Foundation, and
are under assorted licenses.  Mostly, but not entirely, GPL.

The license of each file is stated in that file.
Additionally, the files in the modules directory state the license of
the code part (in lib/) of the respective module.

Some of the source files in lib/ have different licenses than GPL or LGPL.
Also, the copy of maintain.texi in doc/ has a verbatim-copying license,
and doc/standards.texi and make-stds.texi are GFDL.  Most (but not all)
m4/*.m4 files have nearly unlimited licenses.
