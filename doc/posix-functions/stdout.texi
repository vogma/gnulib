stdout is created in 32-bit mode instead of 64-bit mode: Cygwin 1.5.x.
One workaround is to use @code{freopen(NULL, "w", stdout)} on Cygwin 1.5.21
or newer.

Another is to use the gnulib @code{ftello} module and do
@code{ftello(stdout)}.

POSIX states that a setuid application can guarantee that fd 1 is
open, but some systems guarantee this even for non-setuid programs.
If an application is executed with fd 1 closed, use of @code{stdout}
can affect an unrelated file that happened to be assigned to fd 1.
The gnulib @code{xstdopen} or the *-safer modules may be used to
guarantee that fd 1 stays
reserved for @code{stdout}.
