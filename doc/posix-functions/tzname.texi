Gnulib module: tzname
@mindex tzname

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This variable is called @code{_tzname} on some platforms:
mingw with @code{-DNO_OLDNAMES}, MSVC.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This variable's contents are unreliable if you use a geographical
@env{TZ} setting like @code{TZ="America/Los_Angeles"}.
@item
The address of this variable is not a compile-time constant on some platforms:
Cygwin, mingw, MSVC.
@item
Native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC) support only a subset of time
zones supported by GNU or specified by POSIX@.  @xref{tzset}.
@end itemize

This variable is vestigial: it is not needed and does not suffice in general.
It is planned to be removed from a future version of POSIX@.
A more portable way of getting the time zone abbreviation is to use
@code{strftime} with the @code{%Z} format.  @xref{strftime}.
