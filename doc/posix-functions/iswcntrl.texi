Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Minix 3.1.8.
@item
This function cannot be called from plain inline or extern inline functions
on some platforms:

@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows and 32-bit AIX platforms, @code{wchar_t} is a 16-bit type and
therefore cannot accommodate all Unicode characters.
@mindex c32iscntrl
However, the Gnulib function @code{c32iscntrl}, provided by Gnulib module
@code{c32iscntrl}, operates on 32-bit wide characters and therefore does not
have this limitation.
@item
This function returns 0 for U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR) and
U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) on some platforms:
macOS 14.
