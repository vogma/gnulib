Gnulib module: ctype
@mindex ctype

Note: This function's behaviour depends on the locale, but does not support
the multibyte characters that occur in strings in locales with
@code{MB_CUR_MAX > 1} (this includes all the common UTF-8 locales).
There are five alternative APIs:

@table @code
@item c_isalpha
@mindex c-ctype
This function operates in a locale independent way and returns true only for
ASCII characters.  It is provided by the Gnulib module @samp{c-ctype}.

@item iswalpha
@mindex wctype
This function operates in a locale dependent way, on wide characters.  In
order to use it, you first have to convert from multibyte to wide characters,
using the @code{mbrtowc} function.  It is provided by the Gnulib module
@samp{wctype}.

@item c32isalpha
@mindex c32isalpha
This function operates in a locale dependent way, on 32-bit wide characters.
In order to use it, you first have to convert from multibyte to 32-bit wide
characters, using the @code{mbrtoc32} function.  It is provided by the
Gnulib module @samp{c32isalpha}.

@item mb_isalpha
@mindex mbchar
This function operates in a locale dependent way, on multibyte characters.
It is provided by the Gnulib module @samp{mbchar}.

@item uc_is_alpha
@mindex unictype/ctype-alpha
This function operates in a locale independent way, on Unicode characters.
It is provided by the Gnulib module @samp{unictype/ctype-alpha}.
