Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows and 32-bit AIX platforms, @code{wchar_t} is a 16-bit type and
therefore cannot accommodate all Unicode characters.
@mindex c32tob
However, the Gnulib function @code{c32tob}, provided by Gnulib module
@code{c32tob}, operates on 32-bit wide characters and therefore does not have
this limitation.
