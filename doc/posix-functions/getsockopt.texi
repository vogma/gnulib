Gnulib module: getsockopt
@mindex getsockopt

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is declared in @code{<winsock2.h>}
instead of @code{<sys/socket.h>}
on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes from this function
are not placed in @code{errno}, and @code{WSAGetLastError} must be used
instead.
@item
On HP-UX 11, in 64-bit mode, when the macro @code{_HPUX_ALT_XOPEN_SOCKET_API}
is not defined, this function behaves incorrectly because it is declared
to take a pointer to a 64-bit wide @code{socklen_t} entity but in fact
considers it as a pointer to a 32-bit wide @code{unsigned int} entity.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms don't have a @code{socklen_t} type; in this case this function's
fifth argument type is @samp{int *}.
@item
On some platforms, this function's fifth argument type is @samp{void *},
not @samp{socklen_t *}:
Solaris 11 OmniOS.
@item
Many socket options are not available on all platforms.
