Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
macOS 14, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 7.5, Minix 3.1.8, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.4.
@item
POSIX specifies that EINVAL should be returned when the file system doesn't
support the allocation operation directly.  glibc however emulates the file system
allocation with writes where unsupported, and apps have depended on
that long term implementation.  This is both inefficient, and as of
glibc 2.21 at least, buggy on certain NFS setups.
