Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows and 32-bit AIX platforms, @code{wchar_t} is a 16-bit type and therefore cannot
accommodate all Unicode characters.
@mindex c32_apply_type_test
However, the Gnulib function @code{c32_apply_type_test}, provided by Gnulib
module @code{c32_apply_type_test}, operates on 32-bit wide characters and
therefore does not have this limitation.
