@mindex c-strncasecmp
The @code{c-strncasecmp} module contains a case-insensitive string comparison
function operating on single-byte character strings, like the functions in
@code{<strings.h>}, that operate as if the locale encoding was ASCII.
(The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

The function is:
@smallexample
extern int c_strncasecmp (const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);
@end smallexample

For case conversion here, only ASCII characters are considered to be
upper case or lower case.

Note: The function @code{strncasecmp} from @code{<strings.h>}
supports only unibyte locales;
@mindex mbsncasecmp
@mindex mbspcasecmp
for multibyte locales,
you need the function @code{mbsncasecmp} or @code{mbspcasecmp}.
