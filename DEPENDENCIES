1) Dependencies for using gnulib-tool (maintainer environment)
**************************************************************

The following packages are needed by maintainers for using 'gnulib-tool'.
We call this the "maintainer environment", although it is not necessarily
a maintainer's or developer's machine; it can also be some containerized
environment.

In general, Gnulib prefers the latest stable version of each package,
but in some cases it also supports older versions; this caters to
commonly-used software distributions that may lag behind the latest
stable package. Support for older versions is not guaranteed, though,
and the version numbers in the following list may be incremented
at any time.

* A C runtime, compiler, linker, etc.
  + Mandatory. Using the platform's native 'cc' gives good portability
    exposure, but you can also use GCC 3.1 or newer.
  + GCC Homepage:
    https://gcc.gnu.org/
  + Download:
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/

* A 'make' utility.
  + Mandatory. Using the platform's native 'make' gives good portability
    exposure for in-tree builds, but VPATH builds on OpenBSD or Solaris
    require GNU Make 3.79.1 or newer.

Locales
-------

If your package includes the tests for the Gnulib modules that you imported,
you will want to maximize the test coverage of these tests, that is, to
minimize the number of tests that are skipped. To this effect, you need to
install a couple of locales, used by the tests.

You can get a listing of the locales installed by default through
  $ locale -a
(Note: On glibc systems, this command displays the encoding names in a
mutilated form, e.g. it transforms "en_US.UTF-8" to "en_US.utf8".)

To install the needed locales on glibc systems:

$ sudo localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
$ sudo localedef -i ar_SA -f ISO-8859-6 ar_SA.ISO-8859-6
$ sudo localedef -i de_DE -f UTF-8 de_DE.UTF-8
$ sudo localedef -i es_ES -f UTF-8 es_ES.UTF-8
$ sudo localedef -i fa_IR -f UTF-8 fa_IR
$ sudo localedef -i fr_FR -f ISO-8859-1 fr_FR.ISO-8859-1
$ sudo localedef -i fr_FR -f UTF-8 fr_FR.UTF-8
$ sudo localedef -i ja_JP -f EUC-JP ja_JP.EUC-JP
$ sudo localedef -i tr_TR -f UTF-8 tr_TR.UTF-8
$ sudo localedef -i zh_CN -f GB18030 zh_CN.GB18030
$ sudo localedef -i zh_HK -f BIG5-HKSCS zh_HK.BIG5-HKSCS

On Debian and Debian-based systems, if you want these locales to be
persistent across automatic system updates, the approach is different:
There, you need to enable the locales in the file /etc/locale.gen and
then run
$ sudo locale-gen
