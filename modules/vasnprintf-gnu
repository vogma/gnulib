Description:
POSIX and GNU compatible vsprintf with automatic memory allocation and bounded
output size.

Comment:
This module should not be used as a dependency from a test module,
otherwise when this module occurs as a tests-related module, it will
have side effects on the compilation of the 'vasnprintf' module, if
that module occurs among the main modules in lib/.
